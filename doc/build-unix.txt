UNIX BUILD NOTES
================

Dependencies
------------

 Library     Purpose           Description
 -------     -------           -----------
 libssl      SSL Support       Secure communications
 libdb       Berkeley DB       Blockchain & wallet storage
 libboost    Boost             C++ Library
 miniupnpc   UPnP Support      Optional firewall-jumping support
 libqrencode QRCode generation Optional QRCode generation

Note that libexecinfo should be installed, if you building under *BSD systems. 
This library provides backtrace facility.

miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is compiled in and
turned off by default.  Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:
 USE_UPNP=-    No UPnP support - miniupnp not required
 USE_UPNP=0    (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime
 USE_UPNP=1    UPnP support turned on by default at runtime

libqrencode may be used for QRCode image generation. It can be downloaded
from http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en, or installed via
your package manager. Set USE_QRCODE to control this:
 USE_QRCODE=0   (the default) No QRCode support - libqrcode not required
 USE_QRCODE=1   QRCode support enabled

Licenses of statically linked libraries:
 Berkeley DB   New BSD license with additional requirement that linked
               software must be free open source
 Boost         MIT-like license
 miniupnpc     New (3-clause) BSD license

Versions used in this release:
 GCC           4.9.0
 OpenSSL       1.0.1g
 Berkeley DB   5.3.28.NC
 Boost         1.55.0
 miniupnpc     1.9.20140401

Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev
sudo apt-get install libdb-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev
sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
sudo apt-get install miniupnpc
sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

If using Boost 1.37, append -mt to the boost libraries in the makefile.


Dependency Build Instructions: Gentoo
-------------------------------------

emerge -av1 --noreplace boost openssl sys-libs/db

Take the following steps to build (no UPnP support):
 cd ${PHC_DIR}/src
 make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=
 strip phcd


Notes
-----
The release is built with GCC and then "strip phcd" to strip the debug
symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.


miniupnpc
---------
tar -xzvf miniupnpc-1.6.tar.gz
cd miniupnpc-1.6
make
sudo su
make install


Berkeley DB
-----------
It is recommended to use Berkeley DB 4.8. If you have to build it yourself:

```bash
BITCOIN_ROOT=$(pwd)

# Pick some path to install BDB to, here we create a directory within the bitcoin directory
BDB_PREFIX="${BITCOIN_ROOT}/db4"
mkdir -p $BDB_PREFIX

# Fetch the source and verify that it is not tampered with
wget 'http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz'
echo '12edc0df75bf9abd7f82f821795bcee50f42cb2e5f76a6a281b85732798364ef  db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz' | sha256sum -c
# -> db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz: OK
tar -xzvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz

# Build the library and install to our prefix
cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/
#  Note: Do a static build so that it can be embedded into the executable, instead of having to find a .so at runtime
../dist/configure --enable-cxx --disable-shared --with-pic --prefix=$BDB_PREFIX
make install

# Configure Bitcoin Core to use our own-built instance of BDB
cd $BITCOIN_ROOT
./autogen.sh
./configure LDFLAGS="-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib/" CPPFLAGS="-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include/" # (other args...)
```


Boost
-----
If you need to build Boost yourself:
sudo su
./bootstrap.sh
./bjam install


To Build (phcd) Headless daemon
--------

cd src/
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1
mkdir obj/crypto
make -f makefile.unix

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building PHC QT,
the graphical PHC.


Security
--------
To help make your PHC installation more secure by making certain attacks impossible to
exploit even if a vulnerability is found, you can take the following measures:

* Position Independent Executable
    Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization
    offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause execution of code at an arbitrary
    memory location is thwarted if he doesn't know where anything useful is located.
    The stack and heap are randomly located by default but this allows the code section to be
    randomly located as well.

    On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this will cause an error
    such as: "relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can not be used when making a shared object;"

    To build with PIE, use:
    make -f makefile.unix ... -e PIE=1

    To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of paxutils, and use:
    scanelf -e ./phc

    The output should contain:
     TYPE
    ET_DYN

* Non-executable Stack
    If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow exploits are possible if
    vulnerable buffers are found. By default, PHC should be built with a non-executable stack
    but if one of the libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake
    and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will silently build an
    executable without the non-executable stack protection.

    To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use:
    scanelf -e ./phc

    the output should contain:
    STK/REL/PTL
    RW- R-- RW-

    The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not executable.
