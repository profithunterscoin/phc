## About Profit Hunters Coin

PHC is a Pow/PoS/Masternode-based cryptocurrency to be used for affiliate
opportunities and online marketing. Assisting new crypto-currency users get
started with peer to peer profits from trading coins on our decentralized exchange.

Dynamic Block Rewards & Firewall implementation is intended to discourage >51% attacks, or malicous miners.
It will also serve as an automatic inflation adjustment based on network conditions. Adjustments based on
live-network hashrate and previous block difficulty define the current block value. This simple algorithm
is designed to simulate real bullion mining: If the difficulty rate is low; using excessive work to produce
low value blocks does not yield large return rates. When the ratio of difficulty adjusts and the network
hashrate remains constant or declines: The reward per block will reach the maximum level, this is when
mining becomes very profitable.

Advanced features to increase coin decentralization such as Block Shield and ASIC Choker are currently in
experimental phase. These will further increase security of the blockchain and reduce hyper-inflation risks.

Profit Hunters Coin (PHC) is a free open source decentralized project derived from Bitcoin.
It's an experimental project with the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient scrypt-based crypto-currency.

## Misc Features:

PHC includes an Address Index feature, based on the address index API (searchrawtransactions RPC command) implemented in Bitcoin Core but modified implementation to work with the PHC codebase (PoS coins maintain a txindex by default for instance).

Initialize the Address Index By Running with -reindexaddr Command Line Argument. It may take 10-15 minutes to build the initial index.
